      <description>“Drinking the Kool-Aid” is a phrase all-too-familiar to the Nebraska fan-base. It usually begins during the spring, when talk comes out about how the football team is practicing. Fans everywhere buy in and get an idea in their head that we’re going to end the season as conference champions. The 2019 college football season is an excellent example of this for Nebraska. In the preseason AP poll, Nebraska was ranked 24th.</description>

Performance on third downs decides whether a team will punt it away, kick a field goal or keep driving down the field. But how much does converting on third downs contribute to wins? Does a team that converts more on third downs make a better team?</description>

      <description>As a sophomore majoring in Sports Media and Communication and Advertising and Public Relations at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is a wide variety of opportunities within those industries. From public speaking, to coding, to creating campaigns, to making videos&amp;ndash; I have been able to dip my toes into just about every area throughout my college experience thus far. I also have continued to seek out real-world experiences through jobs and internships that have helped me continuously learn and gain experience.</description>
