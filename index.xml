      <description>As a sophomore majoring in Sports Media and Communication and Advertising and Public Relations at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is a wide variety of opportunities within those industries. From public speaking, to coding, to creating campaigns, to making videos&amp;ndash; I have been able to dip my toes into just about every area throughout my college experience thus far. I also have continued to seek out real-world experiences through jobs and internships that have helped me continuously learn and gain experience.</description>
